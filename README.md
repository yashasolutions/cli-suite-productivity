# Handy lil' scripts for the day-to-day 

There is a great bunch of tools out there, but somehow I couldn't find an easy way to get some regular tasks done, so I started to  compile some scripts - quite basic but honesly useful. 

## dependencies
- bash (yep, I guess a zsh version might be good for some folks out there, I just dont use zsh.)
- [gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) 


## Commands

- `lf` : list last n files 
- `noblank` disable your screen from going blank 

**Google Drive**
- `glink` 	: turn ID in into gdrive link 
- `glist` 	: list files from gdrive 
- `gshare` 	: share file to gdrive and share link + copy to clipboard 


**Gmail**
- `gmail` 	: send mail using gmail or (or any SMTP server) 
- `gcompose` : integrate with [goobook](https://pypi.org/project/goobook/)


**Code stuff**
- `gissues` : generate gitlab issue templates in your local repo 
- `codefinder` : lazy grep 
- `push` : lazy git command to push changes on branch 

**Content creation**
- `screengrab` : screencast your screen, and save into a new mp4 (dependency on ffmpeg)
